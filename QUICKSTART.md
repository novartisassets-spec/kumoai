## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### "I can't find my access token"
Contact your school administrator. They can regenerate your token.

### "My student isn't being recognized"
Make sure you're using the full name as registered. Try variations:
```
Fatima Hassan (correct)
Fatima (partial - may match multiple)
```

### "The mark sheet wasn't read correctly"
Send the photo again with clearer lighting, or enter marks textually.

### "I need to submit marks in parts"
KUMO automatically merges multiple mark sheet photos:
```
Uploading page 1 of Mathematics marks...
Uploading page 2 of Mathematics marks...
```

KUMO merges and shows combined results.
